# M8_Protest_Symphony

This project is split into subtopics.<br>
Please work in your subtopic folder. <br>
Create a subtopic folder in the individual_code. <br>
When you have a working code that is done, write the **path** of that file in **complete_code/to_merge/list.txt**<br>
<br>
**NOTE HOW TO CODE**<br>
it's a big code so please try to name your variables in a unique and immediately comprehensible way,<br>
I provide an example on how to name the pin that you use and do something similar to the variable names.<br>
if you use a pin for reading or you need a connection, define it with this syntax:<br>
#define A_B_C_PIN<br>
A: something regarding the installation, user input eg=> billboard, globe, decade<br>
B: the type of component used eg=>RFID, potentiometer<br>
C: if needed the type of connection eg=>SDA, RST<br>
<br>
example of the billboard rfid user input:<br>
<br>
#define BILLBOARD_RFID_SDA_PIN 10<br>
#define BILLBOARD_RFID_RST_PIN 9<br>
//SDA and RST are 2 different wires of the RFID reader<br>
<br>
**SCHEMATIC**<br>
please add a schematic of your circuit in the file that you ask to merge so that I can create a complete one<br>
<br>
**Enjoy! :-)**
